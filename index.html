<p>Saavira Kambada Temple (Sāvira Kambada Basadi) or Tribhuvana Tilaka Cūḍāmaṇi), is a basadi or Jain temple noted for its 1000 pillars in Moodabidri, Karnataka, India. The temple is also known as "Chandranatha Temple" since it honours the tirthankara Chandraprabha, whose eight-foot idol is worshipped in the shrine.[1]

    The town of Moodabidri is noted for its 18 Jain temples, but Saavira Kambada Temple is considered the finest among them.[2][3] The temple is considered an architectural wonder and is a major attraction of Moodabidri.
